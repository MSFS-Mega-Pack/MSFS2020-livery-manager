## FAQs

### "I want to report a problem with a livery!"

Please report any issues regarding liveries to the Mega Pack Discord. The liveries are not produced by us, so we cannot fix any issues with them.

### "A livery is failing to install in the manager!"

If a livery fails to install, it's likely the ZIP is corrupted on our server, or while being downloaded. We get an automated alert when a livery fails to install, so you don't need to contact us about this. It should be fixed with 24 hours.

If the livery still fails to install after 24 hours have passed, please [create an issue](https://github.com/MSFS-Mega-Pack/MSFS2020-livery-manager/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+triage+needed&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+Broken+livery:+%3Clivery+name%3E) in this repository.

### "The app is stuck on installing livery 1 of X"

The first livery can take a while to start downloading (up to 1 minute). This is because your PC needs to connect to the API, then to our global CDN, initiate a secured connection, fetch the file, then start serving it to you. Even after this, the speeds are often slow to begin with.

If the manager has been stuck on the first livery for over 5 mins, please restart it and try again.
